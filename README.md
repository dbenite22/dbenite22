### Twine Narrative 

While completing the various mini-assignments, I have been able to add images and videos, center and align images and text, bolden and change the color of the text, while also continuously correcting possible mistakes that were made and created an informational story.

The twine story is an overview of Mary Tudor, her early life, and other people of that time who made an impact in her life or the events at the time.

I was inspired to do this topic based on an event in my early years that introduced me "Bloody Mary" which I breifly go over at the end of the story.
